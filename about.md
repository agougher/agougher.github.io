I'm originally from southeast Michigan, but spent time growing up in Mexico and Germany. After completing a BS from the University of Michigan-Dearborn, I moved to Iowa to do an MS in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Iowa State University. Following a stint in Alabama, I moved to Maryland where I completed a PhD at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of British Columbia.
