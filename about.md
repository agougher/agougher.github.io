I'm originally from southeast Michigan, but also spent time growing up in Mexico and Germany. After completing a BS from the University of Michigan-Dearborn, I moved to Iowa to do an MS in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Iowa State University. Following a stint in Alabama, I moved to Maryland where Iâ€™m currently working on a PhD at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.
