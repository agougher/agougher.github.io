## Phenological sequences
Which tree species flower before their leaves emerge? Do closely related species share similar phenological sequences? Are there climatic or geographic trends in phenological sequences? What are the costs (or benefits) associated with flowering before leaves emerge? These are some of the questions we try to address by studying the sequence (as opposed to strictly the timing) of phenological events. The beginnings of this work can be found [here](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.15270).

## Plant pests and diseases
Emerging, invasive, and even native plant pathogens can have dramatic effects on natural and agricultural systems, yet we often lack a strong understanding of what factors limit their expansion and ranges (e.g., dispersal ability? host availability? environment or climate? management practices?). For my MS, I used _Plum pox virus_ (PPV) as a study system to research how the pattern of hosts (i.e., peach and plum orchards) and management practices affected the spatial and temporal spread of PPV in its non-native North American range.
