## Plant pests and diseases
Emerging, invasive, and even native plant pathogens can have dramatic effects on natural and agricultural systems, yet we often lack a strong understanding of what factors limit their expansion and ranges (e.g., dispersal ability? host availability? environment or climate? management practices?). For my current postdoc, I am using global pest databases to understand the effects of host availability, climate, and geography on the extent and composition of tree pests. For my MS, I used _Plum pox virus_ (PPV) as a study system to research how the pattern of hosts (i.e., peach and plum orchards) and management practices affected the spatial and temporal spread of PPV in its non-native North American range.

## Climate change biogeography
Tree species are often predicted to need to shift their ranges to keep pace with future climate change. The typical ways of predicting range shifts, however, often do not account for population-level local adaptation to climate. This can be problematic as local adapation is a common characteristic of many tree species, and ignoring it can lead to uncertainty in the accuracy of speciesâ€™ predicted future ranges. For my PhD work, I combine genetic information with biogeographical models to (i) assess if including genetic information improves model performance, and (ii) gain new insights into where within the range populations may be most pre- or mal-adapted to future climate conditions. For this work, we use balsam poplar, a wide-ranging northern tree species, as a study system.

## Phenological sequences
Which tree species flower before their leaves emerge? Do closely related species share similar phenological sequences? Are there climatic or geographic trends in phenological sequences? What are the costs (or benefits) associated with flowering before leaves emerge? These are some of the questions we try to address by studying the sequence (as opposed to strictly the timing) of phenological events. The beginnings of this work can be found [here](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.15270).
