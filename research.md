## Phenological sequences
Which tree species flower before their leaves emerge? Do closely related species share similar phenological sequences? Are there climatic or geographic trends in phenological sequences? What are the costs (or benefits) associated with flowering before leaves emerge? These are some of the questions we try to address by studying the sequence (as opposed to strictly the timing) of phenological events. The beginnings of this work can be found [here](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.15270).
